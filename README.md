# discordful-bot

An open source discord bot made with [discordful](https://github.com/Luxizzle/discordful)

discordful-commander is currently in this directory for work in progress reasons. It has its own package.json and node_modules/. This will be moved to a seperate repo later.

## Connecting

Add a file called `auth.js` with the content:
```js
module.exports = 'TOKEN_HERE';
```

You can get the token from your discord developer page
